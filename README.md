# `Deepseek-r1` on Amazon EC2

Here are the steps to serve the [`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) and other models from the `deepseek-r1` family of models on Amazon EC2 using [`vllm`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving.

>The steps provided below are for the 32B distilled version but apply to other variants as well.

1. Create an EC2 instance with the `Deep Learning OSS Nvidia Driver AMI GPU PyTorch` AMI and `g6e.12xlarge` instance type. You can see step by step instructions [here](https://aws-samples.github.io/foundation-model-benchmarking-tool/misc/ec2_instance_creation_steps.html). At the time of this writing the AMI used for `us-east-1` was `ami-067bd563cecc90173`.

1. SSH to your EC2 instance and install docker.

    ```{.bashrc}
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall docker.io -y
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose
    docker compose version
    ```

1. Clone this repo on your EC2 instance.

    ```{.bashrc}
    git clone https://github.com/aarora79/deepseek-r1-ec2
    ```

1. Place your Hugging Face token in file called `/tmp/hf_token.txt` on your EC2 instance.

1. SSH to your instance and run the following commands. Running the `deploy_model.sh` does the following:

    - Downloads the vllm container from Dockerhub.
    - Start the container, this downloads the model from the Hugging Face hub.
    - Create an endpoint accessible as `localhost:8000/v1/completions` to serve the model.

    ```{.bashrc}
    cd deepseek-r1-ec2
    chmod +x deploy_model.sh
    # the container takes about 10-minutes to start
    ./deploy_model.sh
    ```

1. Wait for 10-minutes, and then verify that the container is running.

    ```{.bashrc}
    docker ps
    ```

    You should see an output similar to the following:

    ```{.bashrc}
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
    e21df06d8a7a   vllm/vllm-openai:v0.6.6.post1   "python3 -m vllm.entâ€¦"   10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp   fmbench_model_container    
    ```

1. Now you are ready to run a `cURL` command to get inference from the model.
    
    Here is an example for text inference.    
 
    ```{.bashrc}
    curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B", "prompt": "What is the theory of quantum gravity?", "temperature": 0.6, "max_tokens": 512}' | jq
    ```

    The above command will generate an output similar to the following:

    ```{.bashrc}
    {
        "id": "cmpl-2be25863e97347f7b6d1999a50409add",
        "object": "text_completion",

While quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, general relativity explains the nature of gravity and the large-scale structure of the universe. The challenge is that these two theories are fundamentally incompatible, especially when it comes to understanding phenomena where both quantum effects and strong gravitational fields are significant, such as at the center of black holes or during the early moments of the Big Bang.\n\nThe theory of quantum gravity aims to unify these two perspectives into a single, coherent framework. One of the most promising approaches is string theory, which suggests that particles are not point-like but are instead tiny, vibrating strings. Another approach is loop quantum gravity, which attempts to quantize space itself by describing it in terms of discrete loops or \"spin networks.\" Both of these approaches, and others like them, are still under active research and have yet to be experimentally verified.\n\nIn simple terms, quantum gravity is an attempt to understand how the tiny, strange world of quantum mechanics interacts with the vast, curved spacetime of gravity. It's a quest to find a theory that can describe the universe at its most fundamental level, from the tiniest particles to the largest structures.",

            "prompt_tokens_details": null
        }
    }
    ```

1. You can see traces from the serving container by running the following command:

    ```
    docker logs -f fmbench_model_container
    ```
  
    You should see an output similar to this:

1. You can use [`FMBench`](https://aws-samples.github.io/foundation-model-benchmarking-tool/benchmarking_on_ec2.html) for benchmarking performance of this model.
